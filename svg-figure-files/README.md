# Inkscape SVG Source Files
Inkspace `svg` source files for the vector diagrams used in the paper and presentation. The files are saved in Inkscape's `Inkscape SVG` format and require the TexText Inkscape extension to render LaTeX code. The TexText extension is configured to use the `textext-preamble.tex` LaTeX preamble file included in this directory.
